If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (R-bookdown?) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie, 2015). References Xie, Y. (2015).

Chapters 2 and 3 have described how to fit parametric models to frequency and severity data, respectively. This chapter begins with the selection of models. To compare alternative parametric models, it is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric distribution. Section 4.1 describes nonparametric estimation, how we can use it for model comparisons and how it can be used to provide starting values for parametric procedures. The process of model selection is then summarized in Section 4.2. Although our focus is on data from continuous distributions, the same process can be used for discrete versions or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous distributions. Model selection and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistical modeling. To provide a flavor as to how they can be adapted to alternative sampling schemes, Section 4.3.1 describes estimation for grouped, censored and truncated data (following the Section 3.5 introduction). To see how they can be adapted to alternative models, the chapter closes with Section 4.4 on Bayesian inference, an alternative procedure where the (typically unknown) parameters are treated as random variables. 4.1 Example one 4.2 Example two "],["final-words.html", "5 Final Words", " 5 Final Words We have finished a nice book.
