## Book Description {-}

**Loss Data Analytics** is an interactive, online, freely available text.

- The online version contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote *deeper learning*.
- A subset of the book is available for *offline reading* in pdf and EPUB formats.
- The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a *worldwide audience*.

###  What will success look like? {-}

The online text will be freely available to a worldwide audience. The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. Moreover, a subset of the book will be available in pdf format for low-cost printing. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

###  How will the text be used? {-}

This book will be useful in actuarial curricula worldwide. It will cover the loss data learning objectives of the major actuarial organizations. Thus, it will be suitable for classroom use at universities as well as for use by independent learners seeking to pass professional actuarial examinations. Moreover, the text will also be useful for the continuing professional development of actuaries and other professionals in insurance and related financial risk management industries.

### Why is this good for the profession?  {-}

An online text is a type of open educational resource (OER). One important benefit of an OER is that it equalizes access to knowledge, thus permitting a broader community to learn about the actuarial profession. Moreover, it has the capacity to engage viewers through active learning that deepens the learning process, producing analysts more capable of solid actuarial work.

Why is this good for students and teachers and others involved in the learning process? Cost is often cited as an important factor for students and teachers in textbook selection (see a recent post on the [$400 textbook](https://www.aei.org/publication/the-new-era-of-the-400-college-textbook-which-is-part-of-the-unsustainable-higher-education-bubble/)). Students will also appreciate the ability to “carry the book around” on their mobile devices.


### Why loss data analytics?  {-}

The intent is that this type of resource will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name *loss data analytics* is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available. 


### Project Goal {-}

The project goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. To get involved, please visit our

## For our Readers  {-}

We hope that you find this book worthwhile and even enjoyable. For your convenience, at our [Github Landing site](https://openacttexts.github.io/) (https://openacttexts.github.io/), you will find links to the book that you can (freely) download for offline reading, including a pdf version (for Adobe Acrobat) and an EPUB version suitable for mobile devices. [Data](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Data) for running our examples are available at the same site.

In developing this book, we are emphasizing the [online version](https://openacttexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) that has lots of great features such as a glossary, code and solutions to examples that you can be revealed interactively. For example, you will find that the statistical code is hidden and can only be seen by clicking on terms such as 

`r HideRCode('SeverityFig.1Intro',"R Code for Frequency Table")`

```{r, echo=SHOW_PDF, eval=FALSE}
Insample <- read.csv("data/Insample.csv", header=T,  na.strings=c("."), 
                      stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Insample2010 <- subset(Insample, Year==2010)
table(Insample2010$Freq)
```
</div>
  
We hide the code because we don't want to insist that you use the `R` statistical software (although we like it). Still, we encourage you to try some statistical code as you read the book -- we have opted to make it easy to learn `R` as you go. We have set up a separate [R Code for Loss Data Analytics](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDARcode) site to explain more of the details of the code.

Like any book, we have a set of notations and conventions. It will probably save you time if you regularly visit our Appendix Chapter \@ref(ChapNotationConvention) to get used to ours.

Freely available, interactive textbooks represent a new venture in actuarial education and we need your input. Although a lot of effort has gone into the development, we expect hiccoughs. Please let your instructor know about opportunities for improvement, write us through our project site, or contact chapter contributors directly with suggested improvements.
