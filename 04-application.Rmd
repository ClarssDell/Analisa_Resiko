# Model Selection and Estimation

Chapter Preview. Chapters 2 and 3 have described how to fit parametric models to frequency and severity data, respectively. This chapter begins with the selection of models. To compare alternative parametric models, it is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric distribution. Section 4.1 describes nonparametric estimation, how we can use it for model comparisons and how it can be used to provide starting values for parametric procedures. The process of model selection is then summarized in Section 4.2. Although our focus is on data from continuous distributions, the same process can be used for discrete versions or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous distributions.
